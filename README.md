Process scheduling algorithms implemented in c language: FCFS, SJF, Round Robin (non-preemptive)
for reference- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/

These c programs simulates the process scheduling in an operating system by generating the appropriate gantt charts and must be given input while keeping in mind the following format:

1. Every piece of input must be a positive integer
2. Arrival time of processes can be 0
